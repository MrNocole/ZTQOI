# Introduce
This project implements encoding and decoding the ["Quite OK Image" (QOI)](https://github.com/phoboslab/qoi) format in the Objective-C and Clang.
You can use the lib in Objective-C project directly by #import ZTQOIImage.h to read an .png/.qoi and encode/decode them.

# Dependency
-  ["stb_image.h"](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) 
-  ["stb_image_write.h"](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image_write.h) 

For read and write .png.

# Why Objective-C
A lot of iOS App based on Objective-C.I hope to make an Objective-C lib base on QOI.
